This is a readme file for just the Asynchronous JS concepts I have been going through.

- Firstly `setTimeout()` is a functionality that is provided by the browser and is used in js scripts. It executes a particular block of code once after a specified time has elapsed.
```
setTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2, ...)
```

- Secondly, `setInterval()` is also like `setTimeout()` and is provided by the browser. It executes a particular block of code again and again after a specific interval.
```
setInterval(callback, interval, param1, param2, ...)
```
